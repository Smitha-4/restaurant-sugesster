                <h2>Introduction to model selection</h2>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are supervised and unsupervied machine learning algorithms
                    for making a recommendation system. I
                    am going to use unspervied algorithms to make the model. I will be using k-means algorithm for
                    clustering the restaruant based on different areas in bengaluru. I will also be using TFID method to
                    make the recommedations based on the type of the restaurant.
                    <br>
                    There are many Machine Learning model architures.
                    When I saw the dataset, I wanted to build a machine learning model based off user's reviews,
                    cuisines, restaurant type and location
                    <br>Cuisinies, restaurant type and location were categorical variables. The restaurants can be
                    grouped based on location using clustering architures.
                    <br>The best suited architecture is K-means clustering algorithm.
                    <br> Also I wanted to build a model based on users rating as well. Since Rating was a numerical
                    column, I could easily apply ensemble machine learning model such as XG-Boost. I also tried SVM
                    algorithm.
                    <br> One of the famous filtering method is collaborative filtering using TFIDF. I used this
                    technique on users reviews and Cuisines they serve to filter out the
                    restaurants depending on sentiments scores obtained using TFIDF vectorization and NLP techniques.
                    <br><br>
                    After this I tested the model with the test data as well. In onrder to validate the trained model i
                    used K-fold cross validation technique.
                    <br> The final results were ploted and for collaborative filtering I tested out the function using
                    the name of the dish.

                <h3>Data Transformation</h3>
                <p>Before applying any algorithm, the first step is to scale and transform the raw data into ml model
                    ready input.
                    To acheive this I used one hot encoding. One hot encoding is a method to convert the categorical
                    features into a machine readble values which can be later used for modeling </p>
                <p>To acheive this I used get_dummies from pandas module. I made sure that the cuisines are grouped
                    according to type of the restaurant. Later I again grouped based on different areas of location in
                    Bengaluru. <br>

                    <br>I checked for the number of occurance of each type of restaurant and tried to sort the
                    restaurant based on frequency of occurance. For easier representation, I turned this output into a
                    pandas dataframe.

                <h4>A brief of K-means clustering</h4>
                <p>
                    k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims
                    to
                    partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the
                    nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This
                    results
                    in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster
                    variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the
                    more
                    difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median
                    minimizes
                    Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and
                    k-medoids.
                    <br>The first step in implementing the algorithm is to find the number of clusters. Second,
                    instansiate the algorithm class and
                    fit our data into the model. The following figures shows the exact methods I used. I found that
                    number of clusters were 3 for this problem.

                    <img src="{% static 'ml/ml11.png' %}"><br>
                    Later I checked the columns of the dataframe and sorted it. The result was a dataframe in which the
                    restaurants were clustred based on type of the restaurant and location. The following figure shows
                    the ranking of restaurant types in each area of location.

                <p>TF-IDF Matrix (Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency Matrix)
                    TF-IDF method is used to quantify words and compute weights for them.In other words, representing
                    each word (or couples of words etc.) with a number in order to use mathematics in our recommender
                    system. Put simply, the higher the TF*IDF score (weight), the rarer and more important the term, and
                    vice versa

                    Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar the documents are irrespective of their
                    size.

                    Here, the tfidf_matrix is the matrix containing each word and its TF-IDF score with regard to each
                    document, or item in this case. Also, stop words are simply words that add no significant value to
                    our system, like ‘an’, ‘is’, ‘the’, and hence are ignored by the system.[3]

                    Now, I have a representation of every item in terms of its description. Next, I need to calculate
                    the relevance or similarity of one document to another.</p>
