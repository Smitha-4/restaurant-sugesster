    <h1>Sentiment Analysis of Restaurnat reviews</h1>
</center>

<div class="sub-div" id="Introduction">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In order to find the sentiments of the reviews column in my Restaurant Dataset, I used the following function.
        Later I plotted the graphs and did the sentiment analysis. You can check the following sections below.</p>

        <h3>Sentiment Distribution</h3>
        <img src="{%static 'data-viz/Sentiment Distribution.png'%}" alt="">
    </center>
    <h4>The above image shows the distribution of customer reviews for a restaurant across three
        categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Here's a breakdown of the information it presents:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li><label>Positive Reviews: </label><br> These are the most frequent type of review, accounting for
            39,650 reviews, or 69.5% of the total.
        </li>
        <li><label>Neutral Reviews:</label> These are the second most frequent type, with 24,231 reviews, or
            42.8% of the total.
        </li>
        <li><label>Negative Reviews:</label> These are the least frequent type, with 4,322 reviews, or 7.7%
            of the total.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Key Observations:</h3>


    <ul>
        <li>The vast majority of customers expressed positive sentiment in their reviews, with nearly 70%
            falling into this category.
        </li>
        <li>Neutral reviews are still quite common, suggesting that many customers had an average experience
            that didn't leave a strong positive or negative impression.
        </li>
        <li>Negative reviews are the least frequent, but they still represent a notable portion of the
            feedback. It's important for the restaurant to consider these reviews and address any underlying
            issues.
        </li>
        <li>Summing up the positive, neutral, and negative reviews (39,650 + 24,231 + 4,322 = 68,203) allows
            us to calculate the exact percentages for each category:
            <ul>
                <li><label>Positive Reviews: (39,650 / 68,203) * 100% = 58.2%
                    </label></li>
                <li><label>Neutral Reviews: (24,231 / 68,203) * 100% = 35.5%
                    </label></li>
                <li><label>Negative Reviews: (4,322 / 68,203) * 100% = 6.3%
                    </label></li>
                <li>These updated percentages provide a more precise picture of the review distribution.
                    While the overall trend remains the same (positive reviews being the most frequent), the
                    exact proportions differ slightly from my initial estimates.

    <h3>This table displays information about 10 restaurants, based on online reviews given by users and
        customer
        feedback. </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <label>Average Voting:</label>
            This column shows the average rating or score given to each restaurant, on a
            scale of 0 to 5. Interestingly, four restaurants have an average voting score of 0.
        </li>
        <li><label>Sentiment Score:</label>
            This column displays a sentiment score for each restaurant, calculated based on
            the analysis of customer reviews. Negative scores indicate negative sentiment, with -1 being the
            most
            negative. The most negative sentiment score in the table is -1, belonging to Olive's Restaurant.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3> Some key observations from the table:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is a large discrepancy between the average voting score and the sentiment score for some
            restaurants. A1 Biriyani Point has a high average voting score of 10 but a negative
            sentiment score of -0.6318.
        </li>
        <li>Four restaurants have an average voting score of 0, but their sentiment scores vary. This
            suggests
            that
            these restaurants may have received few reviews or mixed reviews with both positive and negative
            sentiments.</li>

        <li><label>Onesta:</label> Has the highest negative sentiment score (2496) and no positive sentiment

            very positive reception from users based on reviews, ratings, and votes</li>
        <li><label>Onesta: </label>The high negative sentiment score of 2496 (assuming the range goes from
            -1 to
            +1) indicates
            significant negative feedback. Investigating the reasons behind this negativity could be crucial
            for
            improvement.</li>
        <li>Similar scores: Restaurants like Baskin Robin's and Pizza Hut having similar sentiment scores
