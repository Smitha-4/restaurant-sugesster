    <h2> &rAarr; Data Extraction and Collection</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To beign with I collected Zomato Restaurants Data from
        kaggle.com and Extracted other data from
        Swiggy. Zomato and Swiggy are popular apps where most of the food orders are placed on daily Basis
        by people in Bengaluru.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project involes restaurants in Bengaluru.The Dataset is
        obtained by scraping the two popular
        online delivery systems. Swiggy and Zomato. The dataset is separately obtained and later combined to
        make it as one file. The size of the individual files are 0.5GB and 100MB respectively from Zomato
        and Swiggy.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main Aim of this project is to prepare a model which
        recommends restaurants based on dish or
        restaurant type. The final output is to build a web app which shows the user his nearest best
        afforable, high quality restaurants with directions to reach to the place when a particular
        restarant is selected.

    <h2>&rAarr; Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Data came in two separate files. The exctracted data from
        Swiggy contained about 10300 rows of information and Zomato contained 54000 rows of information.
        Columns in Both the files were not equal. Also the files contained missing values, Long text values,
        Location etcera.
        Common Columns included Name of the restaurant, Rating, Cost for people Dining, location area and
        url.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text data had to be cleanned for emoji's, special characters
        etc. I have used regular express and another module called as Clean-Text in-order to clean the text
        data column.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerical columns contained missing values. Duplicated
        Values as well. Those have to be addressed as well.
        Not all numerical columns could be filled with zeros. Depending on the nature of the column and the
        values which are representing the column,
        Numerical columns have to be filled for Missing Values. Although Duplicates can be removed easily.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the datasets were combined and cleanned, The Data in the
        pandas frame was saved to .csv file for all the later use.
        Running the preprocessing everytime before the modeling in the jupyter file is not advisible. It
        takes a lot of time to run the file. So saving the cleanned data in another file is a good practice.

    <h2>&rAarr; Exploratory data Analysis</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have used Statistical ways to build the graph and draw
        meaningfull insights from the data.
        The explanantion for each graph and the dashboard are clearly described in the Analysis page and
        Dashboard Page. I have also used Tableau to build the dashboard.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Overall insights and conclusion drawn from the data are
        explained in the Analysis page.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also done sentiment analysis of the reviews and rating
        of restaurants given by customers while ordering food. This was necessary to know how the reviews
        and rating affect the increase of sales of the particular Restaurants. The Restaurants have received
        both Positive and negative ratings from various customers. Despite the ratings, Restaurants have
        never failed to give their great service and customer satisfaction.

    <h2>&rAarr; Data Transformation</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the machine learning model, the data have to be scaled and
        encoded so that the model can understand the numbers.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dataset I created did not come in separate train and test
        and validation set.
        For the machine learning the spliting of data is highly required to avoid bais and variance of the
        trained model.

    <h2>&rAarr; Building Machine learning models</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Machine Learning model architures.
        When I saw the dataset, I wanted to build a machine learning model based off user's reviews,
        cuisines, restaurant type and location
        <br>Cuisinies, restaurant type and location were categorical variables. The restaurants can be
        grouped based on location using clustering architures.
        <br>The best suited architecture is K-means clustering algorithm.
        <br> Also I wanted to build a model based on users rating as well. Since Rating was a numerical
        column, I could easily apply ensemble machine learning model such as XG-Boost. I also tried SVM
        algorithm.
        <br> One of the famous filtering method is collaborative filtering using TFIDF. I used this
        technique on users reviews and Cuisines they serve to filter out the
        restaurants depending on sentiments scores obtained using TFIDF vectorization and NLP techniques.
        <br><br>
        After this I tested the model with the test data as well. In onrder to validate the trained model i
        used K-fold cross validation technique.
        <br> The final results were ploted and for collaborative filtering I tested out the function using
        the name of the dish.
